## Planets3JS
This is an experiment using Three.js and Cannon-es physics engine. The user pilots a spaceship that can traverse through a 3D space scene. The scene is populated by planets, which are physically simulated using Cannon. They have gravitational fields and will orbit eachother. The player can be affected by these gravity fields and explore the surfaces of the planets.

### Demo
